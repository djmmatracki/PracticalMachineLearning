# Artificial Inteligence


Every day we digitally save data equal to brains of 330 mln people. The speed we come from mesuring data in kilo, mega, giga and terabaits is unbelivable.

But the thing is that raw data is useless. The patterns that we can observe using machine learning algorithms are truly valuable.

What is artificial inteligence? Inteligence is a term used in regard to people and animals, but even if we use it only in terms of the first one it is ambiguous. Psychologists define inteligence as the ability to solve problems (Jean Piaget), ability to see dependence between different processes (Charles Spearman) and many other various definitions.


The famous Turing test allows to answer the question when a machine is inteligent. It says that a machine can be viewed as inteligent when a human can't recognize if he is comunicating with another human or a machine. To this day any machine can't be described as inteligent acording to this test.

Tom Mitchell formulated a definition of machine learning: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
